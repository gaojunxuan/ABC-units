# == HOW TO WORK WITH LEARNING UNIT FILES ======================================
#
# DO NOT SIMPLY  source()  THESE FILES!

# If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help system, Google for an
# answer, or ask your instructor. Don't continue if you don't understand what's
#  going on. That's not how it works ...
#
# ==============================================================================

# === TASK: Local script
#
# - Open the file myScript.R
#
# - Create a section header with a date.
# - Enter an R-expression that will produce the first 11 powers of 2 (starting
#     from 0). Not a loop - a single expression. The first number you get must
#     be 1. The last number you get must be 1024.
#
# - Save the file in the myScripts folder, and close it.
#
# - Open the file again, select the expression and type Cmd+Enter (or Cmd+R)
#   to execute it.
#
# - Done

# (This task is meant  to make sure that writing R expressions, saving
#  them in scripts, opening script files and executing code in the file works
#  for you. If there is an issue, get in touch.)
