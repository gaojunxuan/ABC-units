# == HOW TO WORK WITH LEARNING UNIT FILES ======================================
#
# DO NOT SIMPLY  source()  THESE FILES!

# If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help system, Google for an
# answer, or ask your instructor. Don't continue if you don't understand what's
#  going on. That's not how it works ...
#
# ==============================================================================

# === TASK: Local script
#
# - Open the file myScript.R
# - Update the header of the script to emulate the header of the file you are
#     reading right now. Don't bother giving the myScript.R file version numbers
#     though.
# - Create a section header with a date.
# - Enter an R-expression that will produce the first 21 powers of 2 (starting
#     from 0). Not a loop - a single expression. The first number you get must
#     be 1. The last number you get must be 1024.
# - Save the file.

"There are many more functions for ... that this tutorial did not cover. You should know about the following. Look up the function and write a short bit of example code that uses it:"

?subset
?sweep
?with     # ... and within()

"Then you should know about the following packages. Open the vignette and browse through it. You should know be able to come up with least one use-case where the package functions would be useful:
