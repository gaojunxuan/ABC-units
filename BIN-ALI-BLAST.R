# =    1  Defining the APSES domain  ===========================================

# Load your protein database
source("makeProteinDB.R")

# Get the APSES domain sequence via your MBP1_MYSPE feature annotation. (You
# have entered this data into your database in the
# BIN-ALI-Optimal_sequence_alignment unit.)

( myOrth <- sprintf("MBP1_%s", biCode(MYSPE)) ) # If this is not the correct
                                                # name of the Mbp1 orthologue
                                                # of Mbp1 in your protein
                                                # database, DON'T continue. We
                                                # need to fix this problem.
                                                # Get in touch.

# The MYSPE "apses" sequence is the sequence that we will use for our reverse
# BLAST search.


# =    2  Executing the BLAST search  ==========================================

# The ./scripts/BLAST.R code defines two functions to access the BLAST interface
# through its Web API, and to parse results. Have a look at the script, then
# source it:

source("./scripts/BLAST.R")

# Use BLAST() to find the best match to the MYSPE APSES domain in Saccharomyces
# cerevisiae:

BLASTresults <- BLAST(apses,                       # MYSPE APSES domain sequence
                     db = "refseq_protein",        # database to search in
                     nHits = 10,                   #
                     E = 0.01,                     #
                     limits = "txid559292[ORGN]")  # S. cerevisiae S288c


length(BLASTresults$hits)  # There should be at least one hit there. Ask for
                           # advice in case this step fails.


# =    3  Analysing results  ===================================================

(topHit <- BLASTresults$hits[[1]])   # Get the top hit

# What is the refseq ID of the top hit
topHit$accession

# If this is "NP_010227.1" you have confirmed the RBM of the MYSPE apses
# domain. If it is not, ask me for advice.
