# == HOW TO WORK WITH LEARNING UNIT FILES ======================================
#
# The R-scripts and datasets in this project will be continuously updated,
# and updates will be posted on GitHub. To bring your version into the latest
# state use the Git-pane (top left) and "pull" (blue downward arrow) from the
# repository. However, this will overwrite locally edited version of files.

# To edit code and experiment with it, for example to add your own comments and
# examples, save your edited version into the "myScripts" folder. Otherwise you
# may have problems with git when you update the project to a new version. It's
# good practice to change the filename, for example by prepending your initials.
# This helps distinguish the files you are working with e.g. in a list of
# recent files. For example if your name is Honjo Tasuku, your edited
# BIN-Sequence.R might be named HT-BIN-Sequence.R

# If you pull from github and get the following type of error ...
#     ---------------
#     error: Your local changes to the following files would be
#     overwritten by merge
#     ...
#     Please commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
#     ---------------
# ... then, you need to bring the offending file into its original state.
# Open the Commit window, select the file, and click on the Revert button.
#
# When working with these script DO NOT SIMPLY  source()  THESE FILES!

# If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help system, Google for an
# answer, or ask your instructor. Don't continue if you don't understand what's
#  going on. That's not how it works ...
#
#
# ==============================================================================

# Once you have typed and executed the function init(), you will find a file
# called myScript.R in the project directory.
#
# Open it, you can place all of your code-experiments and notes into that
# file. This will complement your "Course Journal". If you keep all contents in
# this one file, you can find everything by using the <cmd>-F find function. To
# cross-reference code in your journal, create section headings.
#
# ==============================================================================

# The individual learning units' files can be opened by simply clicking on them
# in the File pane.
