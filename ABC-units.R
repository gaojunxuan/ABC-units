# == HOW TO WORK WITH LEARNING UNIT FILES ======================================
#
# Expect that the learning unit files will be continuously updated.
#

# If you wish to edit any of the code, for example to add your own comments and
# examples, save any edited version under a different name. Otherwise you will
# have problems with git when you update the project to a new version.

# DO NOT SIMPLY  source()  THESE FILES!

# If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help system, Google for an
# answer, or ask your instructor. Don't continue if you don't understand what's
#  going on. That's not how it works ...
#
# While this file itself should not be edited by you this is YOUR project
# directory, and files that you create (notes etc.) will not be harmed when you
# pull updated version of the master, or other new files, from github.
#
# If you pull from github and get the following type of error ...
#     ---------------
#     error: Your local changes to the following files would be
#     overwritten by merge
#     ...
#     Please commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
#     ---------------
# ... then, you need to bring the offending file into its original state.
# Open the Commit window, select the file, and click on the Revert button.
#
# Of course, you can save a local copy under a different name before you revert,
# in case you want to keep your changes.
#
#
# ==============================================================================

# Once you have typed and executed the function init(), you will find a file
# called myScript.R in the project directory.
#
# Open it, you can place all of your code-experiments and notes into that
# file. This will complement your "Course Journal". If you keep all contents in
# this one file, you can find everything by using the <cmd>-F find function. To
# cross-reference code in your journal, create section headings.

"There are many more functions for ... that this tutorial did not cover. You should know about the following. Look up the function and write a short bit of example code that uses it:"

?subset
?sweep
?with     # ... and within()

"Then you should know about the following packages. Open the vignette and browse through it. You should know be able to come up with least one use-case where the package functions would be useful:
