README - myScripts folder:
==========================

The "myScripts" folder is a place to keep your personal files
safe. No files will be submitted into this folder on the GitHub, master
copy. Thefore everything you put into this folder is safe from being
inadvertently overwritten by a file with the same name that would be
downloaded in a GitHub "pull" request.
